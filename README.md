Spec Finder
===================

This is a fork from the original spec finder from Resellers, the original repo is no longer available on github.

Easily switch between spec and class. Will go out and try to
find the corresponding spec file in your project. It assumes that your spec will have a similar folder structure with the file.

To switch between the file and its spec, simply press:
+ <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> on OS X
+ <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> on Windows and Linux
